# Regulatory Genomics

This repository contains Jupyter noteboooks from my assignments in the course "Comparative and Regulatory Genomics", as part of my MSc in Bioinformatics program at KU Leuven, Belgium.

In `transcriptomics.ipynb`, I ran a bulk RNA-seq analysis to assess differentially expressed genes between healthy control and schizophrenia developing glutamatergic neurons.

In `epigenomics.ipynb`, I ran a ChIP-seq analysis to assess the histone modification H3K4me1 between healthy control and schizophrenia cortical interneurons.
